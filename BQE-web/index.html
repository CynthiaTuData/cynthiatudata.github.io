        On July 8, 1940, a piece of notice arrived for hundreds of tenants living along Hamilton Avenue, Brooklyn.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The families served have ten days in which to remove their belongings,” the notice read, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. “If they still refuse, Sheriff Mangano faces a sterner task of putting their belongings on the street.”

        Tenants on Hamilton Avenue knew that the day would come. A year ago, the city started building the southern extension of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), under the instruction of Robert Moses, the head architect of New York State’s highway system. A tunnel that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn will be put at the starting point of Hamilton Avenue, and the avenue will need to be widened.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first wave of vacate notices was issued in May. In July came the ultimatum. While most who were displaced hustled about finding new sites for their businesses and homes, a few began a tug-of-war with Court Justice Charles C. Lockwood who headed the Legislative Committee of Housing.

          <p>Along Hamilton Avenue, about 1,000 residents were evicted, and some 400 dwellings were razed to make way for the incoming highway. Among the displaced were mom-and-pop business owners, beloved local eateries, residents who had lived in their homes for decades, and about 100 welfare tenants.</p>

        <span class="step-2">
          <p>By July 22, all but 40 families were able to comply with the order. The remaining would plead in court to have their deadline extended, while the banging sound of the power hammer played the tireless reminder.</p>

          <p>After the notice was served on his business at 88 Hamilton Ave, 96-year-old Thomas W. Munkenbeck hustled around town to seek a new location for his pipe and ship fitting shop. Munkenbeck had worked in his shop for 74 years - until one of the air shafts for the highway tunnel was set to be put right on the site.</p>

        Hamilton Avenue was the artery of the buzzing neighborhood of Red Hook. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The present-day Red Hook area was first settled by the Lenape, a Native American tribe. During the summertime, the Lenape people would come to the marshes for fishing and waterfowl hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Dutch colonists arrived at the waterfront area in South Brooklyn in the 1600s, Red Hook had been a vibrant immigrant enclave. A diverse mix of ethnic groups: Dutch, Norwegians, Italians, Puerto Ricans, and Black people (both enslaved people brought over by the Dutches, and free blacks who fled from the South)… have called Red Hook their home. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 1840s into the 20th Century, Red Hook bustled with fishermen, dockworkers, sailors, and shop owners who visited, worked, or lived on the waterfront. “Think of it as a maritime Times Square.” wrote Carolina Salguero, founder of Red Hook Waterfront Stories.

        However, in the eyes of the federal government, Red Hook was one of the least desirable neighborhoods in New York City.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Great Depression hit in 1929, foreclosures swept across cities in America. In hopes of reinforcing better real estate practices, the federal government established the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), an agency that appraises neighborhoods across the country. In the 1930s, HOLC created a series of maps that assess lending risk in different neighborhoods. Neighborhoods were classified into four grades: “best,” “desirable,” “declining,” and “hazardous.”

            Favorable Influences: Proposed Hamilton Avenue tunnel to the Battery in Manhattan.”

        But Shannon Geis, an oral historian who did extensive research on Red Hook in 2013, believes that racial discrimination added to the stigma surrounding Red Hook. “With immigrants and lower-income people working, regardless of whether it was actually a lot of crime happening in the actual neighborhood, it got that reputation. Because there's a lot of racism just associating waterfront with crime.” Geis said.
